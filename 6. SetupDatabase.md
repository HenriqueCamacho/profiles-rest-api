# Models
    - In Django we use models to describe de data we need for our application
    - Django use these models to configure and store our data in the database
    - Each model in Django maps to a specific table in the Database
        - So we dont need to write any SQL statament or interact with the database directly
    - Django SUPERUSER is a user that can log in to django and see all the models in the database, has full control

# Creating the models
    - Create the User model
        - Django comes with an out-of-the-box default user model that is used for authentication and the admin panel  
            - We're going to override to use email instead of standard username of the default model
        - BEST TO KEEP ALL MODELS INSIDE THE MODELS.PY IN THE APP FOLDER
        - Import AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin, to override the user model(Usually according to Django Documentation)
    - Specify fields like 
        - name, email
        - Logic fields like is_staff and is_active
        - Specify the model managment for our objects, Django needs to have a custom model manager for the user model so it knows how to create/control users using command line tools
        - USERNAME_FIELD = 'email' and REQUIRED_FIELDS to Work with Django Admin and Django authentication system
    - Add functions to Django interacts with the User model like
        - get_full_name()
        - get_short_name()
        - __str__ (return the field that represents the user)()
    - Since we customized the user model, We need to tell Django how to interact with it
        - Default accept a username and a password field, but we changed for email and password

# Django Migration File      
    - The way Django manages the database, it creates the migration file that stores all the steps required to make our Database match our Django Models
    - Everytime we change a model, or add aditional models to the project, a new migration file need to be created
        - Will contain the steps required to modify the database to match the updated models
    - To create these file, we can do with the terminal
        - python manage.py makemigrations profiles_api
            - This will create the file in the app profiles_api
    - Usually we should not modify this file
    - python manage.py migrate
        - This will manage all the migrations, create all required models/tables in the database for any of our models and any of the dependencies we have

# Django  models classes
    - UserProfileManager --> Manager for user profiles, mange the instances of the model
    - UserProfile --> Define a type of object which is stored in the data backend. In a nutshell, each model represents a table in the database, and each instance of that model is a row in that table.
    - All models need a manager, however in most cases a default manager is assigned by Django behind the scenes, so you don't have to think about it yourself.
    - The UserProfile model is one of the few cases where you do need to provide a custom manager. This is because we need to ensure the set_password() method is used to encrypt the users password before saving the model.
    - In order for the manager to manage model instances, we need 2 things:
        - The manager must be assigned to the model, which is what we do in UserProfile model when we have: objects = UserProfileManager()
        - The manager must be able to access the model class which it is managing, so it can create instances of that model. When a manager is assigned to a model, Django will set the model variable on the manager to a reference to the model being managed.
    - We need to set AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'profiles_api.UserProfile' to let Django knows that our user authentication model is that one in that model class
