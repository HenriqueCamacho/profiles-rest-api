# ViewSets
    - Allow us to write the logic for our endpoints
    - Accepts functions that map to commom API object Actions like
        - list --> Getting a list of objects, the url is the root defined in DefaultRouter().register()
        - create --> Creating new objects
        - retrieve --> Getting a specific object
        - update --> Updating an object
        - partial_update --> Updating part of an object
        - destroy --> Destroying objects
    - Automatically maps to URLs using Routers
    - Takes care of a lot of typical logic for us
    - Perfect for standard database operations
    - Fastest way to make a database interface
    - When to use ViewSets over ApiViews
        - A simple CRUD interface to your database
        - A quick and simple API for predefined objects
        - Litle to no customization on the logic
        - Working with standard data structures
    - In the base URL, only works the list function and POST method
        - For the other methods we will specify a primary key id in the URL like /1/

# Creating a ViewSet
    - Create the class in views.py that inherits viewsets.ViewSet    
    - Create the methods(list, create, retrieve ...)
    - To register the URL's is a little diferent with viewset
        - Use a router(Class provided by the django rest Framework), generate diferent routes that are available for our viewset
    - We need to register with DefaultRouter().register() passing the endpoint without the /,  view we want to register such as views.HelloViewSet, and the base_name='hello-viewset'
        - Include the path in the url_patterns[] with include(router.urls)
