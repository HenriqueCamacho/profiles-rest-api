# Creating WorkSpace for our Source Code
    - Create in ~ Home/user directory
        - It's easier for navigating in terminal
        - In general create with in WorkSpace folder
        
# Create a README.md file
    - Remenber things

# Create a .gitignore   
    - File to exclude some files from being tracked     
        - Local database files
        - Python binary files
    - Only commit base text source   
    - We can use tool for creating this file such as
        - https://www.gitignore.io/api/python,vagrant --> Here for Python and Vagrant

# Creating LICENSE File
    - Best practise to include license for project
        - What they are allowed to use
        - Can't sue me for liability for this project  
    - MIT License
        - Anyone can do whatever they want with this code   

# Git
    - git add -A is equivalent to git add .; git add -u.
    - The important point about git add . is that it looks at the working tree and adds all those paths to the staged changes if they are either changed or are new and not ignored, it does not stage any 'rm' actions. --> New files and modifications
    - git add -u looks at all the already tracked files and stages the changes to those files if they are different or if they have been removed. It does not add any new files, it only stages changes to already tracked files.
    - git add -A is a handy shortcut for doing both of those.
