# Django REST Framework Views
    - APIViews uses standard HTTP Methods for functions
        - def GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE
    - Helper classes to help to create the API endpoints
    - APIView   
        - Most basic type
        - Describe logic to make API endpoints
        - Gives the most control over logic
        - Good for implementing complex logic such as
            - Calling other APIs
            - Working with local files
        - Personal Preference but use when
            - Full control over app logic such as
                - Running a complex algorithim
                - Updating multiple sources in one api call
    - ViewSet 

# Creating Api View
    - Import APIView and Response(Django expects a response when it calls the function)    
    - Create the class that is going to be mapped to a URL inheriting from APIView
    - Methods accepts 
        - request(Passes by Django, contains the details of the request being made) 
        - format=None, add a format suffix to the end of the endpoint of the URL
    - It needs to return a Response that accepts a Dictionary or A List
        - It converts to Json
    - The URL's are stored in urls.py in the app directory
        - But we need to include in the url path in the urls.py in the PROJECT folder
        - For that we need to import include
        - Add path('api/', include('profiles_api.urls') to the urlpatterns list, that is the app name and the module where the url's are
        - Now, we need to add the same url_pattern[] to the urls.py of our app, with the url(endpoint) pointing to the class.as_view() to be rendered by url's
