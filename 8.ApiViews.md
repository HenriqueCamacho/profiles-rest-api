# Django REST Framework Views
    - APIViews uses standard HTTP Methods for functions
        - def GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE
    - Helper classes to help to create the API endpoints
    - APIView   
        - Most basic type
        - Describe logic to make API endpoints
        - Gives the most control over logic
        - Good for implementing complex logic such as
            - Calling other APIs
            - Working with local files
        - Personal Preference but use when
            - Full control over app logic such as
                - Running a complex algorithim
                - Updating multiple sources in one api call
    - ViewSet 

# Creating Api View
    - Import APIView and Response(Django expects a response when it calls the function)    
    - Create the class that is going to be mapped to a URL inheriting from APIView
    - Methods accepts 
        - request(Passes by Django, contains the details of the request being made) 
        - format=None, add a format suffix to the end of the endpoint of the URL
    - It needs to return a Response that accepts a Dictionary or A List
        - It converts to Json
    - The URL's are stored in urls.py in the app directory
        - But we need to include in the url path in the urls.py in the PROJECT folder
        - For that we need to import include
        - Add path('api/', include('profiles_api.urls') to the urlpatterns list, that is the app name and the module where the url's are
        - Now, we need to add the same url_pattern[] to the urls.py of our app, with the url(endpoint) pointing to the class.as_view() to be rendered by url's

# Add a Serializer to our view
    - Allows to convert data inputs into Python objects
        - Receive content from POST and UPDATE methods
        - Create serializer.py script(Keep all serializers in this file)
    - Also takes care of validation
    - Create the Serializer class(can have any name) 
        - Must inherit from serializers.Serializer)
        - Defines the field expected(name of variable will be the name of the field) 
            - We can make some validationsi.e max_length=10
        - In the post method(or put/patch), and validate with methods like
            - Get the serializers class in our api class
            - Instantiate the class in the post method, passing data = request.data
            - .is_valid()
            - serializer.errors --> Take the error of one or more fields(At the same time)
            - .validated_data.get --> Get the data
        - In the Patch,Put and Delete methods, it requires primary key to be passed
