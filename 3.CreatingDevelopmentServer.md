# Create Vagrantfile
    - Create development server to develop and test our API
    - Define type of server as a vagrant file and install this file with the source code of our project
    - vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64 --> Initializes our project with a new vagrant file and bases it on ubuntu/bionic64 base image
        - These images are public available in vagrant catalog box

# Configure our Vagrant box        
    - Customize for ou particular requirements
        - config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64" --> Image
        - config.vm.box_version = "~> 20200304.0.0" #Specific version of image, to not break the course steps...
        - config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8000, host: 8000 
            - Guest --> The os in vm Box 
            - Host --> The pc which vmBox is running
            - So if guest is running at 80, we can acess by 8080(or other port) on our guest machine
        - config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL #Run scripts when we first create the server

# Running and connecting to our dev server      
    - Changing dir to root of our project
    - Type vagrant up
        -Download the base image we specified in our vagrant file 
        - Then use Virtual Box to create new Virtual Machine and then provision script when starts machine
    - Need to enable Virtualization in the bios

# Once started
    - Conect to the vagrant server by using vagrant ssh comand
    - Since our box is a completely isoleted box in the machine, Guest OS, need to conect trough ssh
    - Type vagrant ssh
    - Type exit to go back to the host machine

# Use our Development server when we are Working on our project  
    - All the files in our development server are different from our local machine i.e not synchronized
    - Vagrant works by creating a synchronized directory in our vagrant server that updates itself with all the files in our local project everytime we make changes
    - cd /vagrant/ --> Everything in this vagrant folder is syncronized with everything in our project folder
