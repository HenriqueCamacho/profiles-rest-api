# Development Server >> local machine
 - Local OS is faster but can create a number of problems such as
    - Difficult to work collaboratively
    - Run app in different OS
    - Conflict with other apps
    - Clogs up our system with dev tools
    - Run code in a different machine than our production server

# Vagrant
    - What kind of server we need for our app
    - Save config as a Vagrant File  
    - Use VirtualBox to create the server just as we described
        - Our app code and requirements are installed and configured in a virtual server
    - Easy to share the server with others
    - Exact same version of all requirements
    - Run exactly the same software as a real production server
    - Easily create and destroy the server as we need

## Docker vs Vagrant
    - Simmilar, both use virtualization technology to isolate the application from the machine that is running on
    - Docker 
        - Open source
        - Run app in light-weight image
        - Image --> lightweight striped down version of Linux
            - Run app in Local development machine
            - Or deploy to a production server 
        - Designed to run in production 
        - Steper learning curve
        - Limited versions available for Windows Home

    - Vagrant
        - Manage virtual development enviroment
        - No "out-of-the-box" virtualization technology
        - Use Hypervisor such as VirtualBox
        - Create vagrant file wich contain all the instructions for creating the development server
        - Use hypervisor to create and configure the machine
        - Steamlined but complete version of Linux OS
        - Easier learning curve vs Docker
        - wider range of support
    
    - When to use
        - Use docker for
            - Streamlined workflow
            - All developers use supported OS
        - Use Docker for
            - Just Getting started
            - Need support on wider range of OS

# Application code
    - VsCode
    - Python 3 - Write logic for our application
    - Django 1.9 --> Web Framework for Python
        - Django Rest on top of Django
            - Provides set of features for making standard Rest Api
    - Chrome Browse extension ModHeader --> Allow us to modify the http headers when testing the api
