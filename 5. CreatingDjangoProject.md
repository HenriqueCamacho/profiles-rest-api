# Creating the django project and app
    - django-admin.py startproject profiles_project .
        - Call the django-admin.py script and start the project with the name "profiles_project" and the location we want to create the project(.), the . is optional, if not specified it will create a subfolder called profiles_project, but we want to create in the project root
    - Create an app within our project  for our profiles API
        - python manage.py startapp profiles_api
    - Django app can consist of one or more sub applications within our project to separate different functionality within our project
        - We are going to create one API, so create just one app

# Enable the app in our django project
    - profiles_project --> Settings.py --> Add app to "INSTALLED_APPS" list
        - Don't forget some required apps for the api, such as 
            - 'rest_framework', #Django rest framework we installed earlier
            - 'rest_framework.authtoken', #Authentication token functionality that comes out of the box with the rest framework
            - 'profiles_api' #Our newly created app

# Test and commit our changes            
    - Django comes with a handy development server we can use to test our changes in the browser as we make to the projects
        - Connect to the vagrant box, working on the enviroment(env)
        - Type python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 -> Asks django to run the development web server. 0.0.0.0 means make available on all network adapters in our development server starting in port 8000(mapped in Vagrantfile)
