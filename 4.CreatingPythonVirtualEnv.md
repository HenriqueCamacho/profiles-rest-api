# Create python Virtual Enviroment
    - Install all dependencies isolated in that folder, not globally
        - Django Rest framework
    - Is a set of files which we work on and installs in the directory all the dependencies when we install with the python package managment
    - python -m venv ~/env --> Creates a new file in our vagrant server home directory called env and creates the python enviroment there
        - Not synchronize the enviroment with our local machine so if we need to destroy and recreate the vagrant server from scratch, we can create with a fresh python virtual enviroment 
    - That's because the vagrant folder is synchronized with our local machine
    - Need to activate/deactivate on the virtual enviroment
        - source "path" ie.  source ~/env/bin/activate
        - deactivate

# Install the required Python Packages
    - Django
    - Django Rest framework
    - Create requirements.txt and list all dependencies
        - django == 2.2 --> Without the ==, install the latest
        - pip install -r requirements.txt
